# HCDE 410 Final Project, University of Washington, Murtaza Ali
## Project Goals
This project aims to determine the different factors which have historically influenced student admissions into Ivy League colleges. In particular, the aim of this project is to see if the admissions standards of these universities are really as holistic as they publicly claim.

## Relevant Files
- proj_proposal.ipynb: Original file outlining proposal and plan for project
- report.ipynb: Final project report, which contains elements copied over from the proposal as well.
- LICENSE: Gives details of licensing for the code in this analysis.
- chatgpt.md: This file records the queries made to and responses obtained from ChatGPT as part of the research process, for full transparency.

## Licensing
This code is licensed under the MIT License and the data is obtained from the National Center of Education Statistics, as well as from publicly available data from the universitt websites themselves. Details about data licensing are described in the report itself, but is copied again below for convenience:

"Under law, public use data collected and distributed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) may be used only for statistical purposes. Any effort to determine the identity of any reported case by public-use data users is prohibited by law. Violations are subject to Class E felony charges of a fine up to 250,000 dollars and/or a prison term up to 5 years. NCES does all it can to assure that the identity of data subjects cannot be disclosed. All direct identifiers, as well as any characteristics that might lead to identification, are omitted or modified in the dataset to protect the true characteristics of individual cases. Any intentional identification or disclosure of a person or institution violates the assurances of confidentiality given to the providers of the information. Therefore, users shall:

Use the data in any dataset for statistical purposes only.

Make no use of the identity of any person or institution discovered inadvertently, and advise NCES of any such discovery.

Not link any dataset with individually identifiable data from other NCES or non-NCES datasets. To proceed you must signify your agreement to comply with the above-stated statutorily based requirements. This window will close and you can now download the file."

## Notes/Special Considerations
Graphics are not explicitly provided as PNG files. However, as part of Altair's in-notebook functionality, users can easily download the graphics as local files after running the relevant notebook cells by clicking the three dots in the top right corner of the visualization.
