    "# ABSTRACT\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook contains a report as well as an analysis (in wonderful, intertwined, new-age data science format) of the undergraduate admissions practicies of the 8 Ivy League Universities: Brown, Cornell, Harvard, Dartmouth, Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania. Originally, quantitative research questions were posed, aiming to determine with statistical significance what factors most correlated with admissions prospects. However, due to data limitations, the research questions and methodology were altered to take a more exploratory and ethnographic below, with the details documented throughout. I find that while the Ivy Leagues are holistic in some sense, they still tend to admit a very particular type of student, and that they emphasize specific qualities (such as stellar academics, for example) as baselines more than they let on. I conclude that if this information was more clearly available, it is possible many more students could have a fairer shot at admission into these schools."

    "# INTRODUCTION\n",
    "The Ivy League Universities have been the coveted colleges for American and international students for decades. Notoriously difficult to gain admission into, many of these schools report on holistic (and ultimately, fair) admissions policies on their websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, such claims stand in direct contradiction to countless personal anecodotes and national-level news stories, such as the recent college admissions scandal. In this notebook report, I study the various factors which influence a student's admission into Ivy League Universities, and determine if these schools really are as holistic as they claim to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be perfectly clear, the intention of this exploration and analysis is not necessarily to reveal anything dramatic (although that would definitely be interesting). Rather, the goal is to discover if there is any disconnect between the stated admissions criteria of these universities and what the data actually reflects. This could be as simple as an official statement which claims need-blind admissions (in terms of finances) and data which shows otherwise, or as astonishing as an internal policy which accepts anyone who donates enough money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically speaking, this is important because any finding that differs from the schools' official statements is important for potential applicants to know. Many young students quite literally dedicate their lives into getting into these schools. If one is going to do this, it's helpful to know what to focus on. As such, the overarching goal of this analysis, stated imply, is to determine the factors that most influence a potential student's admission to these universities."

    "# BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\n",
    "For convenience, I am listing the primary references I will use here, rather than at the end, as is traditionally done:\n",
    "1. [Wealth, Legacy, and College Admission](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-019-00377-2)\n",
    "2. [The Future of College Admissions: Discussion](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-019-00377-2)\n",
    "3. [Merit and Competition in Selective College Admissions](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/262793)\n",
    "\n",
    "Though I will undoubtedly find other relevant work as I work on the project (to be cited at the end), my reading of the three works above indicates that they provide a solid foundation to build on. This is primarily because many of the findings are related to my research goals, but still provide room for me to explore more (there doesn't seem to be exclusive focus on the Ivy Leagues in the existing work, though mention of top schools is certainly made). They additionally provide information across a fair span of time, which will help me to trace how policies have (or have not) evolved over the last two decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Killgore splits college admissions into two types: 1) merit based, which focuses on academic and non-academic achievements, and 2) competition based, which chooses students based on organizational needs (e.g. sports teams, band, etc.) [3]. Her findings indicated that \"a) elite colleges’ maintenance of an illusion that student achievement determines admissions, and (b) that admissions practices are designed to maintain the colleges’ elite status.\" This connects to my first question, which focuses on the factors that influence admission.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the more recent 2019 paper [1], the authors explicitly state, \"Actually, the admissions scandal at Harvard and Yale, and other prestigious colleges, is just another example of how the rich and powerful make the rules or change and bend them to suit their own interests– and at the expense of ordinary people who are just trying to keep their heads above water and pay their bills.\" This seems to indicate social class does indeed play a large role in admissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data I have available (see subsection below), I don't expect I will be able to make definitive determinations about factors like social class. However, I do anticipate there is much to be learned about the points Killgore makes above. Specifically, I suspect there may be evidence pointing to the fact that admission into these universities is not simply about student achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing my primary research questions, I provide a bit more helpful context in the subsections. First, let's take a direct look at what these colleges claim about admissions on their official websites. Then, let's see what the data looks like."

    "## What do the universities claim?\n",
    "Below are excerpts taken from the official admissions websites of the Ivy League Universities. They provide helpful background on the analysis and discussion that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brown**: _\"Brown's admission process is holistic, and we review every application. The admission statistics available through Brown Facts, as well as grade and score ranges for the Class of 2026, may help to provide a broad perspective of the academic strength of our pool of applicants. However, please be aware that these data points are not a set of requirements and should not be used to predict odds of admission.\"_\n",
    "- **Cornell**: _\"Cornell is happy to provide general admissions statistical data from the most recently admitted class to help provide prospective applicants with a broad understanding of the kind of highly qualified candidates that have been admitted in the past. The Class Profile numbers, however, should not be interpreted to mean that objective data are the most important criteria in the selection process. Other factors, such as secondary school curriculum and performance, special talents, extracurricular activities, application essays, and interviews (where required) are critical to Cornell's decision making process as well.\"_\n",
    "- **Harvard**: _\"There is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, his or her ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities.\"_\n",
    "- **Dartmouth**: _\"Every applicant is reviewed individually and holistically . We are aware that in many cases multiple applicants attend the same secondary school, and the decision for any one applicant will not determine the outcome of another.\"_\n",
    "- **Columbia**: _\"The Columbia University first-year class of College and Engineering students is chosen from a large and diverse group of applicants. Columbia employs a holistic approach in assessing candidates in order to evaluate which students are the best matches for Columbia's unique educational experience. In the process of selection, the Committee on Admissions considers each applicant's academic potential, intellectual strength and ability to think independently. The Committee also considers the general attitudes and character of the applicant, special abilities and interests, maturity, motivation, curiosity and whether they are likely to make productive use of the four years at Columbia. In its final selection, Columbia seeks diversity of personalities, achievements and talents, and of economic, social, ethnic, cultural, religious, racial and geographic backgrounds.\"_\n",
    "- **Princeton**: _\"For each class, we bring together a varied mix of high-achieving, intellectually gifted students from diverse backgrounds to create an exceptional learning community. We care about what students have accomplished in and out of the classroom. As you prepare your application, help us to appreciate your talents, academic accomplishments and personal achievements. We'll ask for your transcript and recommendations, and we will want to know more than just the statistics in your file. Tell us your story. Show us what’s special about you. Tell us how you would seize the academic and nonacademic opportunities at Princeton and contribute to the Princeton community.\"_\n",
    "- **Yale**: _\"Students commonly want to know what part of the college application 'carries the most weight.' The truth is, there are many parts to your application, and together they help us discover and appreciate your particular mix of qualities. Academic criteria are important to Yale’s selective admissions process, but we look at far more than test scores and grades.\"_\n",
    "- **University of Pennsylvania**: _\"We look for students who aspire to develop and refine their talents and abilities within Penn’s liberal arts-based, practical, and interdisciplinary learning environment. Our ideal candidates are inspired to emulate our founder Benjamin Franklin by applying their knowledge in 'service to society' to our community, the city of Philadelphia, and the wider world. To best understand prospective students’ paths through Penn, we approach applications holistically and with great care.\"_"

    "At the risk of being facetious, I must say, it almost sounds like all of the above are the same exact paragraph, rewritten into 8 different variations by ChatGPT.

    "## The Data\n",
    "I plan to use data from the [Institute of Education Sciences](https://ies.ed.gov/) (IES), which describes itself as \"the nation's leading source for rigorous, independent education research, evaluation and statistics.\" More specifically, my data will come from one of their sub-organizations, the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/) (NCES). My data will be curated from their extensive [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter) (IPEDS), which allows users to select the institutions they are interested in as well as a list of variables from a huge number (quite literally hundreds) of available ones. This lends itself nicely to my overall research goals, and will help me home in on specific research questions as I explore."

    "At this point, I seem to have run into a bit of an issue. It seems I did not consider the limitations of the data closely enough with regard to my initial research questions. In particular, I only have access to aggregate data regarding admissions. That is, there is no individual mapping of factors such as grades, test scores, etc. to admission outcome. This makes it difficult to quantitatively answer my first research question, as there is no outcome variable I can use to train a potential model. It also makes it downright impossible to answer my second question, as I cannot conduct a correlation analysis for each factor vs. admission outcome when I don't have individualized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, I have a couple of options. I can change my research questions entirely and start from scratch, I can go hunting for additional data that might enable me to better answer these questions, or I can shift my research goals and methodology slightly to better align with the data I already have available. I will choose the third option, as it is the most realistic when taking into consideration both my time and knowledge restrictions.\n",

    "### Part 1: [The Columbia Admissions Page](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/)\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "- Interesting opening: \"Dear Aspiring Columbian: Take a deep breath. Now, let it out. The college application process is a personally meaningful milestone, and there are many resources to support you. This is a time to discover who you are, imagine who you want to become, and decide whether Columbia College or Columbia Engineering might be the right college for you.\" Go on to say that what they are looking for is the best _match_. But how do I become that?\n",
    "- \"Columbia is test-optional and does not have a \"cut-off\" GPA or test score for admission, and academics are considered alongside the full application.\"\n",
    "- Some of the Columbia-specific application questions: \"List the titles of the books, essays, poetry, short stories or plays you read outside of academic courses that you enjoyed most during secondary/high school (75 words or fewer).\"Why are you interested in attending Columbia University? We encourage you to consider the aspect(s) that you find unique and compelling about Columbia (200 words or fewer).\" \"In Columbia’s admissions process, we value who you are as a unique individual, distinct from your goals and achievements. In the last words of this writing supplement, we would like you to reflect on a source of happiness. Help us get to know you further by describing the first thing that comes to mind when you consider what simply brings you joy (35 words or fewer).\" Seems to support this idea of being holistic, but how much do these essays really matter?\n",
    "- Adjectives they use to describe admissions process: holistic, contextual, need blind, and committee based.\n",
    "- Seems to indicate that if I need financial aid, I will get it.\n",
    "- Look for academic preparation, curiosity, engagement with others, individual voice, knowledge of Columbia.\n",
    "- They really want people to be excited about this Core Curriculum of theirs. I should look into this more.\n",
    "- \"Our responsibility is to admit students who will be successful in our rigorous curriculum, so first and foremost the review is grounded in an examination of the applicant's past and current academic performance. Only after a foundation of academic excellence has been demonstrated will other areas of achievement and potential for impact be considered.\" This quote stands in direct opposition to the claims of being holistic (it is on a different page, the Testing Policy one, but it is still within the admissions site).\n",
    "- Standardized tests are optional. Keeps saying \"not a disadvantage\" if you don't submit them, but also will be reviewed if submitted. These two things feel somewhat contradictory. Why not exclude them altogether?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflection\n",
    "There are a number of interesting points scattered throughout the Columbia admissions page. However, what I found most confusing is that there almost seems to be a contradiction in the advice they give to aspiring students. On the one hand, they encourage taking it slow, emphasize that their process does not look for a specific grade or test score, and insist that they just want students who are the best match. On the other hand, they also directly state, \"Our responsibility is to admit students who will be successful in our rigorous curriculum, so first and foremost the review is grounded in an examination of the applicant's past and current academic performance. Only after a foundation of academic excellence has been demonstrated will other areas of achievement and potential for impact be considered.\" By its very definition, such a process is no longer holistic, since it quite literally places one metric first among all others. I am not quite sure what to make of this, but so far, I think they are really misrepresenting what they mean by holistic. They want people to _think_ their holistic process will encourage all aspects of an applicant equally from the get-go, but in reality, it feels like once academic excellence is established, other things are considered. This would imply that many people with great GPAs and ranking do not get in, but those that do get in have high GPAs and rankings. This also seems to match with some of the quantitative data above."

    "- \"If you have a goal of getting into Columbia, you will have to obtain As in nearly all of your high school classes, receive top scores on your standardized admission test, write compelling essays, and participate in extracurricular activities that showcase your abilities and qualities.\" This seems to match what I wrote in the previous section's reflection. But I need more.\n",
    "- This page seems to emphasize test scores much more than Columbia's official page. Maybe it is outdated. Or maybe it's trying to tell me something. But later on, the page does mention that Columbia is test optional now.\n",
    "- \"While most students do not want to write their essays for their applications to Columbia, the essays and short answer questions are critical.\" Are they really that critical? I want to know more about this in particular.\n",
    "- \"Many high school students have the idea that they have to participate in as many extracurricular activities as possible to stand out on their college applications. When you are applying to an elite institution like Columbia, however, this approach is not effective. Columbia is more interested in the quality of your participation in your extracurricular activities rather than in how many you have participated in.\"\n",
    "- \"If you do not receive an invitation to be interviewed, don’t worry. This is not a sign that your application will be denied.\" Don't know if I believe this.\n",
    "- \"Make certain that you have a written schedule that you follow. You should carve out time in your schedule each week to relax and have fun. High school students are expected to have some fun and to build strong relationships with others. If you study all of the time and never take time for yourself, you will miss out on key developmental opportunities and appear to be one-dimensional.\" Ach. Even having fun is about getting into college now, indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflection\n",
    "There was not a huge amount of new information on this forum, but it did change, or rather, sharpen, some of my previous thoughts. Specifically, my suspicion that grades matter more than Columbia lets on officially, as a baseline at least, seems to be supported by the material on this page. However, there are a few claims made here that I am skeptical about, and want to explore further in the next section below. Specifically, I feel like an interview does indicate that you might have a better chance at admission, and that the essays don't matter nearly as much as this page claims. Let's see what Reddit has to say about these topics."

    "### Part 3: [Columbia Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/)\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "- Regarding interview chances: \"Possibly but don’t read too much into it. My year a lot of people I talked to didn’t get an interview offer at all but got in so not getting one doesn’t necessarily mean much. How many interviews they conduct depends on a lot of other factors.\"\n",
    "- On a post where someone asked for tips about getting in: \"Think of a good reason why you want to go. Get a perfect SAT score. Ask your parents to donate at least 10 million dollars to Columbia. Have President Obama write your recommendation letter.\"\n",
    "- Some say the Core Curriculum, because required, can actually be restrictive if you want to study something specific deeply.\n",
    "- One piece of advice from current students for essays was to try and stress a broad set of interests.\n",
    "- \"high school senior thinking about double majoring in CS and environmental engineering, and premed, and possibly go into law as well. Do you think it’s possible to double major as well as premed and prelaw, on top of Columbia’s core curriculum?\" Not super relevant, but saddens me a little, and felt it worth noting.\n",
    "- \"Yeah burnout is real. Enjoy the high of getting in. Read for fun. Learn about something irrelevant. Learn how to make pasta from scratch. You'll have plenty of time to study and hate yourself later.\"\n",
    "- Within the essays, the idea of match comes up again: \"The admissions officers want to know that you aren't just applying to Columbia for the sake of applying, and get to know your interests and how they would be best explored at Columbia over any other school.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflection\n",
    "I found browsing the Reddit forum to be particularly useful because it highlighted/provided information that was lacking within the official pages and college forums above. In particular, it seems what they say about interviews officially is the truth: Not getting one doesn't necessarily hurt your chances of acceptance. That's good to know. Of course, there is also the matter of the essays. One admitted students advised an applicant, \"The admissions officers want to know that you aren't just applying to Columbia for the sake of applying, and get to know your interests and how they would be best explored at Columbia over any other school.\" This seems to indicate that I was half right about the essays. They don't appear to be of the utmost importance, _but_ they do play a role. Almost like checking a box off on a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, I realize one could reach the conclusion that maybe the process is holistic after all. I mean, they don't _just_ use grades, but they expect good ones, and they don't _just_ use essays, but the essays need to reveal that you've done your homework about Columbia. Isn't that holistic? I am not so sure, however. I feel like it is more a situation where they look at these baselines, and then they want someone who has done something incredible (e.g. Started a nonprofit, won a national competition in STEM, competed as a D1 athlete, etc.). This may not seem obvious from the ethnography above, but there are subtle hints. For example, the middle step, where I studied the GoingIvy forum, emphasized quality of extracurriculars over quantity. It seemed to imply you needed to be stellar in something. Then there is that quote from Reddit which ends with Obama writing a rec letter, for example. I am not sure how to classify this type of admissions process, but it sure isn't holistic, as in a scattered way, the admitted applicants seem to fir similar overall profiles."

    "By and large, it's quite clear that the Ivy League universities stress how _holistic_ their overall process is. At the beginning of this analysis, when I looked into some background and related work, this seemed to be the case. The quotes taken from their official pages, especially, seem to affirm this claim. At the same time, the additional review of related work at the start seemed to suggest that these quotes were not to be taken at face value, and indeed the data supports this somewhat."

    "## What the Data Shows\n",
    "Let's start with the exploratory data analysis. We can see from the graphs generated above that by and large, students admitted to these universities tend to have high GPAs, class rankings, and test scores. Yes, some data is missing, but the general trend is clear. Taken just by itself, this might be a little misleading, as it suggests that just high grades are enough. However, if that were the case, more studets would get in than there is space available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ethnography revealed something quite interesting. The word \"holistic\" at face value seems to suggest that it's not all about grades and scores, so how can this be reconciled with what the data seems to show? Well, a study of Columbia's official admissions page seems to reveal that academix excellence is an important baseline. In fact, this page (which is a bit deeper and not on the front admissions page, which is interesting) states quite clearly that only after academic excellence is established are other qualities considered. Additionally, Phase 2 of the ethnography (reviewing a professional admissions consulting site) emphasizes this point, and also builds upon it. In particular, it indicates that beyond academics, admissions officers expect to see extremely high quality in whatever extracurriculars are chosen. If you are an athlete, you should be competitive at the national level. If you are in a club, you should hold a leadership position and use it to accomplish something meaningful and impactful. So on and so forth. Finally, a review of the final part of the ethnography hints, somewhat jokingly, at the incredible level of accomplishment needed to secure admission (e.g. sardonically suggesting getting a letter of recommendation from Barack Obama).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these things in mind, I summarize the tentative findings of my work. Based on the exploratory data analysis above and the ethnography, it seems a prospective Ivy League student should keep the following things in mind if they wish to maximize chances of admission:\n",
    "\n",
    "- While there is no official minimum for grades and test scores (and in some cases test scores are not even required), these universities expect strong applications to showcase strong evidence of academic rigor and excellence. This is far from the only necessity, but the data suggests that it tends to be an important starting point.\n",
    "- The number of extracurricular activities is not that important. This is important to mention as many students often try to join as many clubs as possible to appear attractive to these schools. However, it seems that these schools want to see incredible levels of achievement in 1-2 areas. Put simply, to have a chance at admission, one needs to stand out at whatever they do.\n",
    "- The term _holistic_ is a little misleading. It seems to suggest, especially with other wording on the page, that perhaps academic excellence doesn't matter that much (since there is no official minimum), or that involvement in many different things can be attractive. The reality seems to be that no specific things are officially required, but both strong academic performance and some other factors that makes an applicant stand out immensely are important in the decision-making process."

    "As mentioned earlier when I shifted my research question, the methodology used above (specifically, an exploratory quantitative analysis followed by an ethnography) would not have been appropriate for my initial research questions, which involved making definitive statistical claims about factors influencing admissions. However, they fit well with my revised research question, which doesn't seek to mathematically determine the connection between various factors and my final conclusion, but rather explore them from a qualitative lens. In particular, I wanted to know what is most important from the specific _perspective_ of a student applicant. For this, an ethnography taking on the persona of an applicant exploring the process of applying to one of these colleges felt appropriate. Additionally, the initial exploratory data analysis (conducted before the research question revision) provided me with some context for what appears to matter most for these admissions, and helped me to outline the high-level structure of the ethnography before actually conducting it."

    "## Implications\n",
    "The best way to discuss the implications is to draw a distinction between what a student might think matters for gaining admission into these universities at first glance, and what actually ends up mattering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the way these schools market themselves, especially on their front pages, it's very easy to assume that the word \"holistic\" is somehow synonymous with \"diverse.\" However, there is a difference between a diverse campus and a diverse individual. I know from experience, as well as from the work above, that it is very easy for students to fall into the trap of thinking that if they just do many different things, they will be a strong candidate for admission. However, the reality appears to be that they need to be academically strong no matter what, and then they really need to excel in 1-2 areas. This makes for a diverse campus overall, as everyone's individually strong extracurriculars will combine together in the admitted student pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the implications of this work are important. As it stands, this doesn't seem to be super well known. It isn't immediately obvious from the admissions pages; it is almost veiled somehow, hidden in a way. It is something I have heard anecdotally, and it is a theme that only _starts_ to emerge even after all of the work above. Even though the methods are qualitative, it is unlikely the majority of applicants consider and review material this deeply before applying (for instance, I never checked forums like Reddit, and I applied to many Ivy Leagues, unsuccessfully, as a high schooler). If this were to be stated more directly and publicly, I think many more students would have a fair shot at acceptance into these schools, especially as they would be able to start prepping early on."

It is reasonable to loosely extend the implications to the other Ivy Leagues, particularly in light of the similarities discovered during the background work and exploratory data analysis, but it would still be a useful area of future work to conduct similar ethnographies for the other universities as well."

    "Overall, it appears to be the case that the Ivy League Universities are holistic, but not necessarily in the way they claim to be. In the related work, I referenced a paper which discussed how these colleges don't actually admit based on student achievement, but on the basis of maintaining their elite statuses. This appears to be somewhat true, but in a more subtle way that still gives the illusion of student achievement being the only factor at play.\n",

    "In particular, the admissions process does take into account academic performance as well as the unique abilities and contributions of students. However, almost all admitted students seem to follow the same pattern: They performed extremely well academically, and they are extremely talented in some extracurricular. This makes it so that pointing to an individual student that is admitted supports the idea of holistic admission, but it also restricts admissions to a narrow paragon of excellence, which helps maintain the elite images these colleges wish to portray and protect. Of course, there must be exceptions, but this seems to be the general tale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though I did not end up fully exploring my initial first research question due to the data limitations, I do think the work here supports my original hypothesis at least indirectly. It does appear that two factors, academic and extracurricular excellence, seem to play quite the large role in admissions. However, they are broad enough that they can be split into many different factors if presented in the right way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future work, I would like to explore the influence of more niche factors, such as social class, donations, athletic potential, etc., on admission to these colleges. This work sets a good foundation for exploring such questions, and I would be curious to see, through a different set of data, if they are interrelated in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for now, I return to my original question: How holistic are the Ivy Leagues, really? By their definition, pretty holistic. But by the definition that comes to mind for most people, maybe not so holistic after all."
