    "## What do the universities claim?\n",
    "- **Brown**: \"Brown's admission process is holistic, and we review every application. The admission statistics available through Brown Facts, as well as grade and score ranges for the Class of 2026, may help to provide a broad perspective of the academic strength of our pool of applicants. However, please be aware that these data points are not a set of requirements and should not be used to predict odds of admission.\"\n",
    "- **Cornell**: \"Cornell is happy to provide general admissions statistical data from the most recently admitted class to help provide prospective applicants with a broad understanding of the kind of highly qualified candidates that have been admitted in the past. The Class Profile numbers, however, should not be interpreted to mean that objective data are the most important criteria in the selection process. Other factors, such as secondary school curriculum and performance, special talents, extracurricular activities, application essays, and interviews (where required) are critical to Cornell's decision making process as well.\"\n",
    "- **Harvard**: \"There is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, his or her ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities.\"\n",
    "- **Dartmouth**: \"Every applicant is reviewed individually and holistically . We are aware that in many cases multiple applicants attend the same secondary school, and the decision for any one applicant will not determine the outcome of another.\"\n",
    "- **Columbia**: \"The Columbia University first-year class of College and Engineering students is chosen from a large and diverse group of applicants. Columbia employs a holistic approach in assessing candidates in order to evaluate which students are the best matches for Columbia's unique educational experience. In the process of selection, the Committee on Admissions considers each applicant's academic potential, intellectual strength and ability to think independently. The Committee also considers the general attitudes and character of the applicant, special abilities and interests, maturity, motivation, curiosity and whether they are likely to make productive use of the four years at Columbia. In its final selection, Columbia seeks diversity of personalities, achievements and talents, and of economic, social, ethnic, cultural, religious, racial and geographic backgrounds.\"\n",
    "- **Princeton**: \"For each class, we bring together a varied mix of high-achieving, intellectually gifted students from diverse backgrounds to create an exceptional learning community. We care about what students have accomplished in and out of the classroom. As you prepare your application, help us to appreciate your talents, academic accomplishments and personal achievements. We'll ask for your transcript and recommendations, and we will want to know more than just the statistics in your file. Tell us your story. Show us what’s special about you. Tell us how you would seize the academic and nonacademic opportunities at Princeton and contribute to the Princeton community.\"\n",
    "- **Yale**: \"Students commonly want to know what part of the college application “carries the most weight.” The truth is, there are many parts to your application, and together they help us discover and appreciate your particular mix of qualities. Academic criteria are important to Yale’s selective admissions process, but we look at far more than test scores and grades.\"\n",
    "- **University of Pennsylvania**: \"We look for students who aspire to develop and refine their talents and abilities within Penn’s liberal arts-based, practical, and interdisciplinary learning environment. Our ideal candidates are inspired to emulate our founder Benjamin Franklin by applying their knowledge in “service to society” to our community, the city of Philadelphia, and the wider world. To best understand prospective students’ paths through Penn, we approach applications holistically and with great care.\""

    "According the the data and corresponding labels above, it seems that in 2021, admissions test scores were considered but not required for all of these schools. The implication of something like this is that perhaps they are not that important. This outward information has been the case for the past few years, it seems. Nevertheless, the schools still publish the mean test scores of admitted students in their class profiles. Let's look at the most recent data:\n",
    "- Brown: SAT: Middle 50% between 1500 and 1570, ACT: Middle 50% between 34 and 36\n",
    "- Cornell: No data on average score, but profile says 41% of enrolling students submitted SAT, 20% submitted ACT\n",
    "- Harvard: No information on class profile about testing.\n",
    "- Dartmouth: SAT Reading/Writing: 733, SAT Math: 750, ACT: 33\n",
    "- Columbia: SAT: Middle 50% of students between 1490 and 1560, ACT: Middle 50% between 34 and 35.\n",
    "- Princeton: SAT: Middle 50% between 1490 and 1580, ACT: Middle 50% between 33 and 35.\n",
    "- Yale: No data published, explicitly acknowledge it was because the test scores were optional.\n",
    "- University of Pennsylvania: SAT: Middle 50% between 1510 and 1560, ACT: Middle 50% between 34 and 36."

    "As far as admissions scores go, it seems like the Ivy Leagues can be taken more at their word. Yes, it is true that the reported scores are still high (especially for being the middle 50%), but at the same time, it seems like many of the universities (especially Yale, Cornell, and Harvard) seem to be acknowledging the fact that test scores are optional and placing less weight on them in the admissions decisions."
